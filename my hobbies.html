  <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8; max-width: 700px;">
    My hobbies are closely aligned with my professional interests. I enjoy exploring the beauty and wellness industry by researching trends, testing new products, and learning how brands position themselves online. I also spend time learning about e-commerce platforms and strategies, particularly how to build and manage online stores effectively.

  <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8; max-width: 700px;">
    In my free time, I often watch tutorials and case studies related to digital marketing, product branding, and implementation strategies to integrate these skills into real-world projects. These activities not only fuel my passion but also contribute to my personal growth and long-term goals in the beauty business space.
